WeatherApp
==========

iOS 7 simple weather app that displays current temperature in world capitals.

Purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with technologies listed below.

- Storyboards - new technique for dequeing cells from storyboard
- iOS 7 Autolayout - it seems with iOS 7 using autolayouts became super easy, although 
  I haven't tried frame animation with autolayout yet.
- Experimenting with `[UIFont preferredFontForTextStyle:]`
- `UIActivityIndicatorView`
- `NSURLSession` - quick hack to see how it is different from [NSURLConnection](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURLConnection_Class/Reference/Reference.html) or [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)
